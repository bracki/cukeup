    Feature: Manage websites via REST API
      As a jimdo developer
      I want to manage websites via a REST API
      So that I can test new features easily

    Scenario: Create a new website
      When I send a POST request to "/api/websites" with body
      """
      {
        "username" : "cucumber",
        "title" : "Can I haz Cukes?"
      }
      """
      Then the response is application/json
      And the status is 200 OK
      And I can reach the website with username "cucumber"
      And the website html title is "Can I haz Cukes?"
